# Description: Report/Reflection for the CS310 Final Project: Declarative Configuration

1. What was the purpose of this project in your own words?
    - The purpose of this project was to deploy CraftRoast's site on our server and monitor it using a grafana instance.
      We also added 1 admin account and 2 dev accounts for CraftRoast.

2. Describe each task. What did that task accomplish, how did you accomplish it. Use complete sentences.
    - (I am assuming this means the 4 tasks for Project 4 because there was only one full assignment for Project 4).
      For the digital e-commerce site, we installed Bagisto using a separate playbook than the main one. We had 3 tasks that created
      a directory for the site, copied the docker-compose file for Bagisto, and finally one that ran the Bagisto site.
      We have a playbook that does each of the other tasks, installing a grafana instance, and setting up the 2 dev accounts
      and the 1 admin account.

3. Explain 3 hurdles/misconceptions you encountered whilst working on the project. How did you overcome these hurdles?
    - One massive hurdle was that we were trying to pull the whole bagisto repo down instead of using docker hub to install an image of bagisto.
      We fixed it by just following the documentation as we should have from the beginning.
      Another hurdle was at the beginning, just learning more about playbooks. We knew the concept on paper but writing them had a small learning
      curve. Honestly, it wasn't that bad to learn how to write them. We just looked at some examples, such as yours (Ian's).
      One last thing, we kept on forgetting to run sudo on some commands so that held us back until we figured out why by researching. Also, when
      we ran into the error once, it made it easier to detect the same error again later.

4. Explain 2 things you would do differently if you had to re-do this project?
    - I would actually read more of the documentation instead of trying to do things a different way. I would also explore the documentation and
      add more variation/customization to the server so that I can learn more about declarative configuration instead of trying to just get it done.

5. (Extra Credit +2 Pts) What is something that could be improved in this project?
    - Something that could be improved is helping us with troubleshooting, or some more guidance on that. It was sometimes hard
      to know what we were doing wrong when we got errors. I think at least a lecture or two on that would be very useful
      because a lot of programming will be troubleshooting.
